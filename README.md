# Vizagrams 

Vizagrams is a visualization framework that integrates **diagramming**
and **data visualization**, with the goal of providing high
expressiveness with intuitive usability.

The framework implements a diagramming DSL together with a
visualization grammar, thus allowing users to create diagrams by
combining and transforming plots, as well as to create new
visualization specifications using diagram construction operations.

This Lean implementation is still under development.
